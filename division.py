#Qst: write a code in python that divide two numbers and print the result
#Step 1: create two variables to hold in each number from the user
#Step 2: Change the the numbers into integer for calculation
#Step 3: Create another variable to hold the result and 
#perform calculation (divide the two numbers)
#Store the answer in result variable
#Step 4: Print the result

#Step 1
num1 = input("Enter your first number: ")
num2 = input("Enter your second number: ")

#Step 2
num1 = int(num1)
num2 = int(num2)

#Step 3
result = num1 / num2

#Step 4
print(result)
